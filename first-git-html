<h2>The plan</h2>
<p>For a case modification, I would like to build a computer, out of parts I have around already, in a desk. I<br>
already have: a power supply, a hard drive, 2GB of ddr2 RAM, a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a<br>
desk that I am not using. I will have to buy a cheap motherboard, and processor, probably from<br>
craigslist. It will not be a very powerful PC, but it will be fun to build and (hopefully) functional. I will<br>
probably load some flavor of Linux onto it. The plan is to screw the parts onto the bottom of the desk (it<br>
has a compartment for books and such under the desktop) and cut some holes for IO and ventilation. I<br>
have looked online, and it has been done before multiple times, though the desk is usually custom built.<br>
I could not find any pictures of anything that will look like mine, but I have included pictures of other<br>
peopleâ€™s computer desk mods.</p><br>
